# Virtual secretary Sakura-chan powered by ChatGPT
## Introduction
ChatGPT is known as a very good interactive AI. But has anyone ever asked it to do a girl's talk? ChatGPT is a very good at writing sentences, but I think most of us have been treating "her" in a stiff tone of voice.  
On the day I first came into contact with ChatGPT   

>I had a very unpleasant request: "Please speak in a junior high school girl's way in the following conversation.

(As a side note, I have to say that ChatGPT is a very nice tool.  
(As a side note, ChatGPT has an AI that gives itself a title when you open a new chat space. (As a side note, ChatGPT gives itself a title when you open a new chat space, so I came up with the absurdly named "junior high school girls' speaking request.)   

## Breakthrough
And today, when I asked her to speak like a junior high school girl because I think you're a junior high school girl...
　
>I said, "Hello! My name is ChatGPT! Let me know if there's anything interesting going on at school or in your club... I'm also into idols these days! Do you have a favorite idol? I love Nogizaka46! 
　

This was the perfect answer! 
This was probably thanks to the breakthrough of the instruction from "speaking requirements" to "make them realize that ChatGPT is a junior high school girl"! 
Then I asked, "Tell me the detailed setting of the junior high school girl you're having role-played now."   

>"Her name is Sakura. She is about 150 cm tall and somewhat petite. Her hair color is black and her hairstyle is a short bob. Her eye color is light brown and her eyes are large, giving her a lovely impression.  
Her personality is bright and active, and she is kind and friendly. She studies hard, gets excellent grades, and is known as an honor student in her school. Her favorite things are cute things and sweets, and she enjoys visiting cafes on her days off. I am a member of the basketball club and my position is shooting guard."

And that's it.  
Perfect. So, using WaifuLab, I took a look at Sakura-chan (she is about 150cm tall and has a rather petite figure. Her hair color is black and her hairstyle is a short bob. Her eyes are light brown and large, giving her a lovely impression.) generated image.

At this point, a new personality "Sakura-chan" is being completed instead of ChatGPT.  
 
## New idea
　So, if we create a new interface (like LINE for example) and use ChatGPT's API, she can be a virtual secretary. This is the idea. So I asked ChatGPT, the normal one.  
>"Yes, the idea of using ChatGPT as a virtual secretary is interesting. We can offer you some ideas.


	Chatbot with images
	We can develop a chatbot that utilizes ChatGPT, and when users interact with it, a character with an image of ChatGPT can be displayed as an image. By designing this character in the style of a junior high school girl and using language similar to that spoken by junior high school girls, users may be able to communicate more naturally.

	Avatar using Live2D
	Live2D is a technology that can move two-dimensional pictures and create more realistic characters. When the user speaks to the character, the character can move and show realistic facial expressions.

	Voice using a voice changer
	In order for ChatGPT to be able to converse in the manner of a middle school girl speaking, it is necessary to focus on voice as well. Using a voice changer, you can change ChatGPT's voice to sound like a junior high school girl. We can also add facial expressions and movements to match the voice as well as Live2D to make the conversation more natural.

	These are just a few ideas we have provided, but there are many other ways. I hope developers will consider which of these methods of expression would work best for them."

Let the development begin. 


## Sakura-chan's exceptional features
　One of Sakura-chan's exceptional characteristics is that she combines the intelligence of ChatGPT with the cuteness of a junior high school girl. 
　The following is a conversation I had with "Sakura-chan" about the operation of a computer operating system more than 20 years ago. 

>"I want to make a parallel connection to a PDA running Windows CE 2.0, but what should the OS of the computer I'm connecting to be?" 

>"If I want to make a parallel connection to a PDA with Windows CE 2.0, Windows 98 or Windows 2000 is the perfect OS for my computer! Since it is equipped with plug and play, the connection is relatively easy to make.
